All Things Optimized

Hi there!
My name is Max Guoxun Yuan.
I am a software engineer
with recommender systems and search relevance as focus.
When I was at school,
my research was on optimization algorithms for large-scale classification and
regression.
Moving on to the industry,
I mainly focus on applied machine learning,
more specifically,
applying machine learning and AI technologies
to optimize web page content
and product recommendations
for marketing use cases.
As a fan of big data technologies,
I like to play with large data sets with Hadoop and Spark.
If you also like any of these,
we may find something interesting to chat about.
