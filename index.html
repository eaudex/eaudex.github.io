All Things Optimized
</h1>
<p>
Hi there!
My name is Max Guoxun Yuan.
Currently, I work as a software engineer
with recommender systems and search relevance as focus.

When I was at school,
my research was on optimization algorithms for large-scale classification and
regression.
Moving on to the industry,
I mainly focus on applied machine learning;
more specifically,
applying machine learning and AI technologies
to optimize web page content
and to personalize product recommendation
for marketing use cases.

As a fan of big data technologies,
I like to play with large data sets with Hadoop and Spark.
