# ML Practice

# What data looks like?
* #observations
* #predictors
* numerical vs categorical
* missing value
* dense vs sparse


## Feature Extraction
* Bag of words
* Term frequency (TF)
* Term frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)

## Features
### Missing Values
* Categorical values:
    1. Simply treat it as a separate value.
* Numerical values:
    1. Impute missing values with the feature mean.
    2. Add one indicator feature for a feature column with missing values to
    indicate its missingness.


## Feature Extraction From Text
* Tokenization
* Stopword Removal
* Stemming
* Unigram, bigram, ..., N-gram


## Models
### Classification
1. Logistic regression
2. Support vector machine
3. Decision tree
4. Random forest
5. Gradient boosted decision tree

### Regression
1. Linear regression
2. support vector regression

### Ranking
1. Ranking as classification
2. Ranking as regression

### Clustering
1. K-means clustering
