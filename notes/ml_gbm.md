# Gradient Boosting Machines

## Boosting
* a machine learning technique to build an ensemble of models (which usually are weak)
  to boost prediction performance
* use additive/stage-wise strategy to build an ensemble of models
* models are usually decision trees


## Gradient Boosting
* fit an individual model to predict the gradient value of the loss
  function
* take a gradient step in the functional space
  to decrease the training loss caused by the ensemble of models built in the
  past

### Theory


### Instances of Gradient Boosting
* AdaBoost
* LogitBoost
